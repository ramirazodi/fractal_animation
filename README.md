# Julia and Mandelbrot Set Visualizations

This project contains Python modules for generating static and animated visualizations of the Julia and Mandelbrot sets, which are famous fractals known for their complex and fascinating patterns. These sets are visualized using the Matplotlib library in Python.

## Modules

1. **juliaset_static.py**
   - This module generates a static visualization of the Julia set. It takes a complex number as a parameter and plots the corresponding Julia set fractal. The module allows for customization of zoom level and color mapping to enhance the visual appeal of the fractal pattern.

2. **juliaset_gif.py**
   - This module is designed to create an animated GIF of the Julia set. It dynamically changes the complex parameter over a range of values, generating a smooth transition effect that visually explores the variations within the Julia set. The animation parameters, including the frame rate and total number of frames, can be adjusted.

3. **mandelbrot_static.py**
   - This module focuses on generating a static visualization of the Mandelbrot set. Similar to the Julia set module, it offers options for zooming and panning across different regions of the Mandelbrot set. The resulting image highlights the intricate patterns and self-similarity characteristic of the Mandelbrot set.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- matplotlib
